once upon a time there lived a monkey , crocodile and crocodile's wife in a forest.
one day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. 
the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.

monkey wanted to make leather cloth, hence wanted to kill crocodile by poisoning fruits.
